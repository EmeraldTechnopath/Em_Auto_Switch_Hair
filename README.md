This script auto-switches your character's (or a companion, if you set it that way) hair to a different hair when camp clothes are equipped.

**Limitations:**

Currently, you cannot change the hair mid-game by any means. It will cause multiple hairs to stack on top of each other.

**Credits:**

Part of the script was written by Wesslen.

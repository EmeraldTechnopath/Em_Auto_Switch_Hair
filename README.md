This script auto-switches your character's (or a companion, if you set it that way) hair to a different hair when camp clothes are equipped.

**Limitations:**

- Currently, you cannot change the hair mid-game by any means. It will cause multiple hairs to stack on top of each other.
- Multiplayer or multi-Tav games won't work since you'd have multiple players at once. You could potentially get around this by setting the targetCharacter to your Tav's UUID.

**Credits:**

Part of the script was written by Wesslen.
